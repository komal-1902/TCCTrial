                    <blockquote>Neo: I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.<br>Morpheus: You take the blue pill, the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red, you stay in wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.<br>
Neo: What are you trying to tell me? That I can dodge bullets?<br>
Morpheus: No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
</blockquote>

                    <p>We all have pondered over the bleak possibility of the world being lucid, unreal and bizarre. What if we are still living on the outskirts of reality? Magic and science forged into one? Sounds like lame science fiction? I agree.  </p>

                    <p>We all have indeed seen the movie - The Matrix. So for just a moment let your mind wander over the small things we have long learnt to ignore. Are we sure the things around us are not just chunks of programs that are made to perform some specific tasks. I believe that the creation of our very planet is much more than sheer coincidence. If we are just an experiment by some other technologically advanced beings, who can switch us on and off whenever they like, is horrifying. If we are asked to choose between embracing the sometimes painful truth of reality and the blissful ignorance of illusion what do you think most of us would do? That we are so embedded in our matrix-style lives that we are unable or more correctly, incapable of seeing the untrue stimulation. Say, for example we have all had Deja vu's. It is claimed that they are the glitches in the matrix. What if enlightenment had a very different meaning that what we thought. We claim to be at the top of the game, but are we? So many questions and so little answers.</p>

                    <p>Blimey! It also implies that just like Neo, we all have our mental barriers which stop us from doing the impossible. I'm not asking people to flirt with danger (jumping high buildings, dodging bullets, like seriously?), I'm asking them to explore. Don't accept whatever has been told. Try it out for yourself because that is the only way to get rid of the oblivion. Change had always had a reputation for being unwanted. We don't want to accept that our "reality" is not so real. I hope that one day, we won't have to guess about the core of our very existence, we'll know. So if you are lucky enough to choose between the two pills, you sure know which one to choose, don't you?</p>
