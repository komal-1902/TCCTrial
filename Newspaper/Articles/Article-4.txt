                    <p>Something extraordinary happened in the Olympics opening ceremony this year. While each country's team got the loudest cheer from their own country, one particular team got a standing ovation from the whole crowd. It wasn't a team of record breakers or gold medalists, but a group of 10 people who had gone through much more than rigorous training and tough competition. They haven't been running to win first place, but to save their lives.</p>

                    <p>To the world, refugees have always been figures of sympathy. But the 10 athletes in the Olympic Refugee Team are not passive victims to the abuses they have suffered. They run, swim and fight not just to win but to make a statement. That despite not playing for any country, they play for the sheer love of the sport.
Unveiling the composition of the Refugee Team, IOC President Thomas Bach said: </p>

                    <blockquote>"These refugees have no home, no team, no flag and no national anthem. This will be a symbol of hope for all the refugees in our world, and will make the world better aware of the magnitude of their crisis."</blockquote>

                    <p>The journey of these athletes - from surviving a war torn nation to being on equal ground with their heroes is truly inspiring. The Refugee Team consists of 10 sportsmen who were selected from among 43 candidates who were verified as refugees by the United Nations. Among these are 2 Syrian swimmers, 2 Congolese judokas, an Ethiopian marathoner and 5 middle-distance runners from South Sudan. And each and every one of their stories is reflective of the incredible odds they have conquered to get to this stage.</p>

<p>For instance, take the case of Yusra Mardini, an 18 year old swimmer who would not have survived had it not been for her swimming skills. While she, her sister and 18 other Syrian refugees were escaping on a small boat from Turkey to Greece, the engine died. Yusra and her sister, who is also a swimmer, pulled the boat to the Greek island of Lesbos over the course of three and a half hours. Another swimmer, Rami Anis fled his hometown of Aleppo in 2011 to escape bombings and kidnappings and went to Istanbul.</p>

                    <p>These people may not have the facilities and luxuries which are available for the others. But that hasn't stopped them from dreaming big and working hard towards making it a reality. While sporting is their passion, they also want to put a spotlight on the violence they suffered and fled from. The Olympics has given them a platform to speak up about the tyranny that millions of people in their countries go through. And by doing they have made the Olympics not just about the sports but about changing the world one game at a time.</p>
