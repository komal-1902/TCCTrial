                    <p>Dear First Years,</p>

                    <p>Congratulations, you got into an Engineering College. You have now acquired a one way ticket to the land of young frustrated engineers, and you are in for one hell of a ride.</p>

                    <p>So, fasten your seat belts and secure your helmets, for your ride through engineering college is bound to be an intense experience- funny and exhilarating, scary and frustrating, all at the same time. You will grow and develop throughout this journey . You'll have to make a lot of choices, some of which you may regret, and numerous others that you will rejoice. But as you do so, I request you to keep the following points in mind :</p>

                    <p><b>1. Your past is past</b><br>
Maybe you didn't get into the college of your dreams. Maybe your score in JEE Mains wasn't as good as you wanted it to be. Or, perhaps, you surpassed all expectations to get the score and the branch that you wanted. Either way, your past is just your past. Don't let it hinder you as you work your way towards the future. Don't let the overconfidence or the insecurity that resulted from your past stop you from achieving something in the future.
</p>
<p>
<b>2. Pursue your hobbies</b><br>
Have an instrument that you want to learn? Or a dance class that you want to join? Do you have a pile of novels in your library, waiting to be read?
<br>
Well, whatever it is that you like, or want to do, go ahead and do it now. Join classes, take up new activities, be a part of the clubs in our college, open clubs in our college. Celebrate the free time that you get, and you will thank yourself in the third year, when you have no time to do anything anymore.
</p>
<p>
<b>3. Acquire some knowledge about your field</b><br>
Studying for your exams is not enough. You need to acquire some extra knowledge about you're the field that you are studying in and your first year is the best time to start doing so. So read some journals, stay abreast of the recent developments. It may not help you now, but when you are appearing for an interview and you know something that no one else does, that one extra nugget of information can change your life.
</p>
<p>
<b>4. Marks are not the only thing that matter</b><br>
Beyond the selection criteria for an interview, you marks don't matter anymore. However, your knowledge about your field does. Do try to keep your aggregate above 60%, but at the same time, work on increasing you knowledge base too.
</p>
<p>
<b>5. Use the internet to your advantage</b><br>
The internet is a gold mine of knowledge and information. Use it to your advantage. Join courses on EDX and Coursera to gain some extra knowledge in the fields that you are interested in. NPTEL is a collaborative project carried out by the IITs and other premier institutes of our country. They provide courses on various subjects on YouTube. Most of the topics in our syllabus are covered in those courses. You can watch their videos to keep up with your coursework.
</p>
<p>
<b>6. Think twice before offending your teachers</b><br>
For those of you who possess a rebellious streak, learn to think twice before questioning or back answering your teacher. Because, while it feels cool to back answer your teacher in the class, the same teacher deducting 25 marks (I speak from my experience) from your term work feels terrible.</p>

                    <p>Enough with the preaching for now. I am sure you will complete you ride through engineering college in 4 years and in good health and spirits. Whatever it is that you want to do after engineering, I hope you get an opportunity to do it. We, The Cummins Chronicle team wish you luck!</p>

                    <p>with Love,
<br>
Your Seniors</p>
