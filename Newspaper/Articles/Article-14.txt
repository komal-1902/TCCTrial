                    <p>Liberalism in India maintains a very unlikely peaceful balance amidst matters like female foeticide, Hunger, Poverty, illiteracy, gender inequality et cetera. I won't hesitate to say that not more than 20% of the citizens of my nation are affected by the present condition of liberalism enough to be willing to bring a change about it.</p>
<p>To understand the Indian idea of liberalism better, one day, I asked my parents about their opinions about it. I learnt some rather obnoxious
things that day. My father was taught to never display feminine traits, like
sensitivity and much emotions in general and My mother, masculinity. It's only in
India, that emotions have a gender. In their elaboration, I understood that the basic
foundation of the globally known idea of liberalism is shattered in a million
pieces in India, and is modified to form a rather degraded version.</p>
<p>The Indian
version of liberalism is laid somewhere in the region of all things tyrannous
and acceptable, to be brutally honest. If we narrow down ideas of liberalism for an average 18 year old female, it'll mostly include freedom of thought,
independence and the liberality to be 'her' kind of happy. It's miserable really,
that a major proportion of such a female's mind space is presently taken up by
thoughts of getting raped and being forced into marriage without having a
chance to build a career. To a large proportion of fellow Indians, Liberalism will
narrow down to Secularism, to some - feminism, to some - political Chauvinism
and to some - Education.</p>
<p>
The beauty of being an Indian is that people realises how messed up their
country's ideas about things like liberalism is and choose to co-exist with it by
writing blogs, and posting facebook statuses against it to show their concern.
Well, the real sad part is, my essay is not making a discovery here. Most
Indians will acknowledge everything I've mentioned, and will in the end, quite
ironically be liberal about it. The it in the previous sentence is not my essay, it
is the Indian version of 'liberalism'. I wonder if I'm mistaken to be living in this
mirage where I think Indians aren't liberal at all. They have their own, but false,
version of it. Or is everyone pulling off a desperateness induced charade of
acceptance. At the end of the day,all everybody wants is a happy life.</p>
<p>
I am striving hard to bring a change, no matter how small, and I want to share
this feeling with people too. Because at the end of the day, we need to ask
ourselves what kind of a nation are we bringing our children into and putting
forward to the world as their largest democracy.</p>
<p>Let's work hard and hope for a better tomorrow. Optimism is the staple diet of a
liberal Indian, after all.</p>
