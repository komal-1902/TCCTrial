The Cummins Chronicle has been started with an elementary perspective of combining multifarious articles at a single place.

The intent of the team is to develop a site that will be able to keep you updated on various events in the college, offer success stories of our alumnis, as well as provide a platform to everyone who wishes to pitch in their writings!

Our constant effort is to adorn the site with articles on the domains we come across everyday and keeping the site fun and knowledgeable at the same time!

Everyone who can, and wants to write, is welcome here.
